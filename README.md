# Tableau Dashboard Project

Welcome to the Tableau Dashboard project, where I leverage Tableau to create an interactive dashboard providing key insights into sales and profit trends. The project encompasses the analysis of user requirements, creation of mockups, data model building, and the implementation of various charts for an enriched visualization experience.

## Project Overview

This project focuses on the development of an interactive Tableau dashboard to analyze and visualize sales and profit trends. It includes key performance indicators (KPIs) such as sales, profit, and quantity by year, along with a dynamic comparison feature with the previous year. The dashboard further breaks down sales and profit by the category of items and presents a weekly trend analysis. The inclusion of interactive filters enhances user engagement and exploration.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have Tableau Desktop installed on your machine for dashboard development.

## Installation

No specific installation is required for this project, as Tableau Desktop is the primary tool for dashboard creation.

## Usage

1. Download or clone the Tableau project repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Ritu-vaja/Tableau-Dashboard-Project.git
   ```

2. Open the Tableau workbook (.twb) file in Tableau Desktop to explore the dashboard and underlying visualizations.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you have suggestions, enhancements, or additional visualizations to contribute, feel free to submit pull requests or raise issues.

## Dashboard Overview

The Tableau dashboard includes the following key components:

- **KPIs by Year:** Explore sales, profit, and quantity metrics for each year, along with a dynamic comparison to the previous year.
- **Sales and Profit by Category:** Visualize the distribution of sales and profit across different categories of items.
- **Weekly Trend Analysis:** Track the weekly trends of sales and profit over time.
- **Interactive Filters:** Utilize dynamic filters for the year to customize and explore data based on specific timeframes.

Feel free to explore and interact with the dashboard to gain actionable insights into sales and profit dynamics.
